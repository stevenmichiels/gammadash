# pytimetk 0.2.1.9000 (Development Version)

### New Functions:

- `augment_diffs()` - Can now add differenced columns
- `augment_fourier()` - Can now add fourier features. 

### Finance Module:


### Polars Backend:

- `augment_diffs()`- Gains a polars backend
- `augment_fourier()` - Gains a polars backend

### General

- Make memory reduction optional #275

# pytimetk 0.2.1

Bugfix - Issue with `augment_rolling(engine='pandas')` and `augment_expanding(engine='pandas')` with concatinating rolled/expanded calc's to the correct group

# pytimetk 0.2.0

### Anomaly Detection

- `anomalize()`: A new scalable function for detecting time series anomalies (outliers) 
- `plot_anomalies()`: A scalable visualization tool for inspecting anomalies in time series data. 
- `plot_anomalies_decomp`: A scalable visualization tool for inspecting the observed, seasonal, trend, and remainder decomposition, which are useful for telling you whether or not anomalies are being detected to your preference.
- `plot_anomalies_cleaned()`: A scalable visualization tool for showing the before and after transformation for the cleaned vs uncleaned anomalies. 

### New Functions:

- `apply_by_time()`: For complex apply-style aggregations by time. 
- `augment_rolling_apply()`: For complex rolling operations using apply-style data frame functions.  
- `augment_expanding()`: For expanding calculations with single-column functions (e.g. mean). 
- `augment_expanding_apply()`: For complex expanding operations with apply-style data frame functions.
- `augment_hilbert()`: Hilbert features for signal processing.
- `augment_wavelet()`: Wavelet transform features. 
- `get_frequency()`: Infer a pandas-like frequency. More robust than `pandas.infer_freq`.
- `get_seasonal_frequency()`: Infer the pandas-like seasonal frequency (periodicity) for the time series. 
- `get_trend_frequency()`: Infer the pandas-like trend for the time series. 

### New Finance Module

More coming soon.

- `augment_ewm()`: Exponentially weighted augmentation

### Speed Improvements

#### Polars Engines:

- `summarize_by_time()`: Gains a polars engine. 
  - 3X to 10X speed improvements. 
- `augment_lags()` and `augment_leads()`: Gains a polars engine. Speed improvements increase with number of lags/leads. 
  - 6.5X speed improvement with 100 lags. 
- `augment_rolling()`: Gains a polars engine. 10X speed improvement.
- `augment_expanding()`: Gains a polars engine. 
- `augment_timeseries_signature()`: Gains a polars engine. 3X speed improvement.
- `augment_holiday_signature()`: Gains a polars engine.

#### Parallel Processing and Vectorized Optimizations:

- `pad_by_time()`: Complete overhaul. Uses Cartesian Product (Vectorization) to enhance the speed. 1000s of time series can now be padded in seconds.
  - **Independent review: Time went from over 90 minutes to 13 seconds for a 500X speedup on 10M rows.** 
- `future_frame()`: Complete overhaul. Uses vectorization when possible. Grouped parallel processing. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores. 
  - **Independent Review: Time went from 11 minutes to 2.5 minutes for a 4.4X speedup on 10M rows**
- `ts_features`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `ts_summary`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `anomalize`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `augment_rolling()` and `augment_rolling_apply()`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.

### Helpful Utilities:

- `parallel_apply`: Mimics the `pandas apply()` function with concurrent futures.
- `progress_apply`: Adds a progress bar to pandas apply()
- `glimpse()`: Mimics tidyverse (tibble) glimpse function

### New Data Sets:

- `expedia`: Expedia hotel searches time series data set

### 3 New Applied Tutorials:

1. [Sales Analysis Tutorial](/tutorials/01_sales_crm.html)
2. [Finance Analysis Tutorial](/tutorials/02_finance.html)
3. [Demand Forecasting Tutorial](/tutorials/03_demand_forecasting.html)
4. [Anomaly Detection Tutorial](/tutorials/04_anomaly_detection.html)

### Final Deprecations:

- `summarize_by_time()`: `kind = "period"`. This was removed for consistency with `pytimetk`. "timestamp" is the default. 
- `augment_rolling()`: `use_independent_variables`. This is replaced by `augment_rolling_apply()`.
